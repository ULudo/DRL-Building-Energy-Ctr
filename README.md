# DRL-Building-Energy-Ctr

This repository "Deep Reinforcement Learning Building Energy Control" hosts the source code for a recurrent reinforcement learning agent, specifically tailored for Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). The agent is trained using a Gym environment based on the CoSES ProHMo Modelica framework. The primary focus of this agent is to efficiently control a building's heat pump and a three-way valve of a thermal storage.
The objective is twofold: to adhere to predefined thermal constraints and to optimize the process with a focus on minimizing electricity costs.


## Getting started

**Install libraries:**
```
pip install torch numpy pandas gymnasium pyfmi tensorflow
```

**Start policy training:**
```
python ./src/train_rsac.py
```
